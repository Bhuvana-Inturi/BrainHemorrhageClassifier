Brain Hemorrhage Classifier
Overview
This project aims to classify brain hemorrhage types (Epidural, Intracranial, Intraparenchymal, Subarachnoid, and Subdural) using CT images. The system includes image preprocessing, a pre-trained deep learning model, and a web interface for user interaction.
Requirements
•	Python
•	Flask
•	NumPy
•	TensorFlow/Keras
•	OpenCV (for potential image preprocessing steps)
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BrainHemorrhageClassifier.git
Use code with caution.
2.	Install required packages:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
3.	Download and place the pre-trained model (model.h5) in the project directory.
Usage
1.	Run the Python script:
Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
2.	Access the web application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5000).
3.	Upload a CT image.
4.	The application will process the image and display the predicted brain hemorrhage type.
Directory Structure
•	static: Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
•	templates: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
•	model.h5: The pre-trained deep learning model.
•	app.py: The main Python script for the web application.
Model
The project utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (likely a CNN) to classify brain hemorrhage types. The model is loaded from the model.h5 file.
Image Preprocessing
The code includes basic image preprocessing steps like resizing and normalization. Additional preprocessing techniques (e.g., image augmentation, feature extraction) can be incorporated for improved performance.
Web Interface
The Flask framework provides a simple web interface for users to upload CT images and view prediction results.
Limitations
•	The accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the training data and the chosen architecture.
•	The current implementation provides basic image preprocessing. More advanced techniques might be required for optimal results.
Future Work
•	Explore different deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet).
•	Incorporate advanced image preprocessing techniques.
•	Develop a mobile app for user convenience.
•	Integrate with medical imaging systems for direct image upload and results.
